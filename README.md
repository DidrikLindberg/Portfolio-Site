## Description 
[Visit the Deployed Site](https://youtu.be/BFyeuLhjcPY)

This is my personal my portfolio website project. I am using basic and some advanced html & CSS components in this project. This project came to be because I have been wanting to build dev projects and siplay them publicly for a while. I want to use this website as as tool to showcase my skills and development over time to potential employers. I want to show that I have the skill to continuouslly learn and improve by displaying a series of projects that are increasingly harder to build to show that I am always improving.
